ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mayank

I am currently pursuing a Master's in Bioinformatics and this repository showcases my learnings and projects on my journey. I am particularly interested in applying statistical 
and quantitative approaches to solve biological problems, hence my projects showcase the use of statistical and machine learning approaches to deal with data. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning unsupervised machine learning approaches to deal with unlabeled and unstructured data, in order to produce optimised datasets for downstream tasts

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mayank

I am currently pursuing a Master's in Bioinformatics and this repository showcases my learnings and projects on my journey. I am particularly interested in applying statistical 
and quantitative approaches to solve biological problems, hence my projects showcase the use of statistical and machine learning approaches to deal with data. Technologies I'm familiar with include, Python, BASH, R, and Linux environments, along with some basic knowledge of C++, SQL and MATLAB.

ðŸŒ± Things Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Leveraging unsupervised machine learning approaches to deal with unlabeled and unstructured data, to produce optimised datasets for downstream tasks
- Enhancing the segmentation and classification of low and high-grade gliomas from MRI images using deep learning methods
